# Testing

> NB: In progress

Todo

- check func signatures with libplctag.h
- add configuration file to avoid hard coded values
- add config file to gitignore
- calculate coverage
- create tests for everything except callbacks

## Test setup

Add a softlink full path to /usr/local/go/src for development we assume is happening in linux environment. Is easier to test locally, than pushing to github then having to `go get` each time there's a new change.

i.e.

```
sudo ln -s /path/to/repo/goplctag/goplctag/ /usr/local/go/src
sudo ldconfig
```

## Running tests

The convention is to have tests inside package, but the package itself is autogenerated so that creates a problem for keeping unit tests intact.

```
cd tests
go test
```
